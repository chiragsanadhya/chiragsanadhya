### 📄 PDF Chatbot with History
**[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/chiragsanadhya/PDF-Chatbot)**

Created an interactive Q&A chatbot for PDFs that retains chat history. This project integrates LangChain for document retrieval and Groq for LLM tasks, with a user-friendly interface built using Streamlit.

- **Objective:** To enable users to interact with PDF documents conversationally, making information retrieval more intuitive and efficient.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, LangChain, Groq, Streamlit
- **Key Features:**
  - Conversational interface for querying PDF content
  - Chat history for context-aware responses
  - Seamless integration with various PDF formats
### 🤖 ModelMatic: Automating Machine Learning Workflows
**[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/chiragsanadhya/ModelMatic)**

ModelMatic is a Streamlit-based application designed to simplify and automate the end-to-end machine learning workflow. It allows users to:

- Upload a CSV file.
- Select an algorithm and specify the train-test split ratio.
- Automatically preprocess data, including encoding categorical variables.
- Train models for classification or regression.
- Generate predictions and display results in a clear, easy-to-understand format.

The app imports functions from custom classes (`Regression` and `Classification`) to handle data preprocessing, model training, and predictions.
